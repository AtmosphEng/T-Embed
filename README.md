## Precautions for factory example:
1. You need to use the [esp32fs plugin](https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin/issues) . The `Arduino 2.x` version does not support the `esp32fs plugin`. Please use `Arduino 1.18.x` to upload resource files.Please refer to the plugin homepage for specific installation and usage methods
2. Please use <Arduino IDE 2.x> during compilation. Please refer to the following figure for specific options

3. The Arduino IDE prompts whether to update the library. Please do not click Upgrade, otherwise the configuration file of [TFT_ESPI] will be overwritten.
